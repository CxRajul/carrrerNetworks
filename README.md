Here, I have created a controller section where based on the questions I have created the files. (Like 1.php, 2.php),
Inside the files, I wrote the MySQL query/Logics related to the Questions,
I have currently used my local machine as the server, so please change the password and databases name accordingly,
I have not answered the 10,11,12 questions due to time constraint and it almost has the simillar type as previously asked questions,
Also, the last question looks like a complicated table structre which requires more details.
Let me know If there are any issues
Thanks!
